# Pursuit

First experiment with Go, where a set of chasers pursue a fugitive on a matrix.

```
> ~/Development/go/pursuit (master) $ go run main.go 
Caught at 2 3 after 4 moves
> ~/Development/go/pursuit (master) $ go run main.go 
Caught at 4 4 after 3 moves
> ~/Development/go/pursuit (master) $ go run main.go 
Caught at 1 2 after 3 moves
```
